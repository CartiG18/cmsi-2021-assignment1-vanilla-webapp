## ℹ️ Info
- **Was generative AI used?:** Yes
- **Provider(s):** Anthropic Claude, Open AI ChatGPT
- **Model(s):** Claude 4.0, ChatGPT 5.0

## 👏 My Experience
- How it was used --> I mainly used ChatGPT and Claude for basic syntactical things I haven't learned about yet and for how to make very specific style adjustments in style.css. For example, I asked ChatGPT how I can implement a Google font for the header. It showed me how to use a font URL inside my index.html file.
- Another thing I learned while using AI is that you can include multiple names in a line like this:
- ```
  <h1 class="iceberg-regular title">Compound Interest Calculator</h1>
  ```
  So that you can reference .title in style.css but also format .iceberg-regular at the same time.
- The good: Both Claude and ChatGPT helped solve syntactical issues encountered and overall saved me a lot of time when polishing the website, esepcially in terms of aesthetics.
- The bad: I noticed that ChatGPT seemed to struggle to maintain a clear line of thought when helping me style my HTML. It would often forget that I used a certain id for an input value and other small things like that.
- Overall I noticed that Claude's responses made much more sense to me and felt more like it was teaching me about CSS and HTML styling. I think that Claude Opus performs significantly better as a coding assistant so far.
