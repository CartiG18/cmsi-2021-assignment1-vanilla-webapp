## 📝 Project Description
This is a **Compound Interest Calculator** web application built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to calculate the compound interest earned on an investment over time, providing an intuitive interface for financial planning and education.

### Purpose
The calculator demonstrates fundamental web development concepts including:
- Interactive user interfaces with form controls
- Real-time data manipulation with JavaScript
- Responsive design principles
- Mathematical computations in web applications

## ✨ Features
- **Principal Amount Input**: Enter the initial investment amount
- **Interest Rate Configuration**: Set annual interest rate as a percentage
- **Compounding Frequency**: Choose how often interest compounds (annually, quarterly, monthly)
- **Time Period Selection**: Interactive slider to select investment duration (1-50 years)
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant results when clicking the calculate button
- **Professional UI**: Clean, gradient background with modern styling
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid calculations with error handling
- **Formatted Results**: Currency formatting with thousands separators

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and form elements
- **CSS3**: 
  - Grid layout for responsive structure
  - Gradient backgrounds and modern styling
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Google Fonts integration (Iceberg font)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**:
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event listeners for user interactions
  - Mathematical calculations using compound interest formula
  - Input validation and error handling

## 🧮 Mathematical Formula
The application implements the compound interest formula:

**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial amount)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- n = Number of times interest compounds per year
- t = Time in years

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Demonstrated
1. **HTML Structure**: Semantic markup using forms, labels, and input elements
2. **CSS Layout**: Grid-based responsive layout with modern styling techniques
3. **JavaScript Functionality**: 
   - Event handling for user interactions
   - Mathematical computations
   - DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates
   - Input validation and error handling
4. **User Experience**: Interactive elements like range sliders with real-time feedback
5. **Code Organization**: Separation of concerns across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Enter the **Principal Amount** (initial investment)
2. Set the **Annual Interest Rate** as a percentage
3. Choose the **Compounding Frequency** (1, 4, or 12 times per year)
4. Adjust the **Years** slider to set the investment duration
5. Click **Calculate** to see results:
   - **Total Earned**: Interest gained over the investment period
   - **Final Balance**: Total amount after compound interest

## 💻 Local Development
To run this application locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
